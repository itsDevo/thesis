# Path

## Step 1: Define the Maze Environment
### Create the Maze Structure:
Define a grid-based maze environment (4x4, 6x6, 8x8).
Add walls and dead ends to increase complexity.
Ensure each maze has a valid path from the start to the goal (bottom-right corner).

### Random Maze Generator:
Implement a random maze generator using an algorithm like Recursive Backtracking or Prim’s Algorithm.
Ensure the generator can create mazes of different sizes and complexities.

## Step 2: Implement the Algorithms
### Q-learning:
Define the state space (agent’s position), action space (up, down, left, right), and reward function.
Implement the Q-learning algorithm with an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy.
Track metrics like success rate, steps to solve, and reward convergence.
Save the Q-table for reuse and visualization.

### Dijkstra’s Algorithm:
Implement Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest path in the maze.
Track performance metrics (time to solve, number of steps).

### A*:
Implement A* with a heuristic (e.g., Manhattan distance to the goal).
Track performance metrics (time to solve, number of steps).

### Greedy Best-First Search (Optional):
Implement Greedy Best-First Search as a non-optimal comparison algorithm.
Track performance metrics (time to solve, number of steps).

## Step 3: Develop the Code Structure
### File Structure:
  #### maze_generator.py: Random maze generator.
  #### game_environment.py: Maze environment and agent movement logic.
  #### q_learning.py: Q-learning implementation.
  #### traditional_algorithms.py: Dijkstra, A*, and Greedy Best-First Search.
  #### visualization.py: Visualization of results (e.g., success rate, steps to solve).
  #### main.py: Main script to run experiments and generate results.

### Documentation:
Add comments to your code for clarity.
Write a README.md file explaining how to set up and run the project.
Include instructions for reproducing results.

## Step 4: Run Experiments
### Train Q-learning:
Train Q-learning on each maze stage (4x4, 6x6, 8x8).
Save the results (success rate, steps to solve, reward convergence).
Run Traditional Algorithms:
Run Dijkstra, A*, and Greedy Best-First Search on the same mazes.
Record performance metrics (time to solve, number of steps).

## Step 5: Visualize Results
### Q-learning Metrics:
Plot success rate over episodes.
Visualize reward convergence.
Analyze exploration vs. exploitation.
Algorithm Comparison:
Compare steps to solve and time to solve across all algorithms.
Use bar charts or line plots for clear visualization.

## Step 6: Write the Thesis
### Organize Results:
Summarize the results of your experiments.
Include visualizations and analysis.
Discuss Findings:
Compare the performance of Q-learning with traditional algorithms.
Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
Prepare Presentation:
Create slides summarizing your thesis for the final presentation.
Highlight key findings and visualizations.
